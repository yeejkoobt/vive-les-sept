# Vive Les Sept
A small social media application similar to that of Facebook written in HTML, CSS, and HTML

## Maintenance
Try not to commit directly onto the master branch when developing. Always try to open a new branch and do a pull request when ready to merge so that others can monitor and review changes.

## Git Tutorials/Reference
If you do not know how to use git, then here are some good reference websites:
* https://git-scm.com/docs
* https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/basic-git-commands-776639767.html
* A Github specific guide: https://guides.github.com/

## IDE: PHPStorm
I always recommend the Jetbrains IDEs for development. Perhaps we can all try to use PHPStorm:

## Skeleton: A CSS Boilerplate framework
I decided that to make development faster - I added this CSS boiler plate framework called Skeleton.
Skeleton provides some nice styles for small projects like one we have here. Hopefully, it will make us
not have to focus too much on prettifying up the html pages that we develop.
